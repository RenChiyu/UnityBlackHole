# FXAA

  FXAA is a popular post-process anti-aliasing technique created by Timothy Lottes. 
  While mostly used in deferred rendering pipelines that lack the ability to use 
  hardware MSAA, it can also be used in combination with hardware anti-aliasing to 
  smooth out hard edges missed by MSAA (e.g. inside polygons).

  Drag and drop onto your camera, no configuration required!
